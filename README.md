## Hi I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Backend engineer working on sharpening up my Go and Python as I think they are both valid and technologically sound languages which the industry will move torwards in the near future. I have 6+ years of proffessional experience in TypeScript and Node.js
but like to get exposure to other tech stacks when I can

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
    - Go, Python, and related API Frameworks like Gin, flask, django

- ðŸ”­ Some random portfolio URLS
    -   [R3BasicAnimations](https://chrisabedi.github.io/r3basicanimation/) small showcase of using animations in React.js and the THREE.js a popular 3D rendering engine
    -   [GO Discord Bot](https://github.com/chrisabedi/league-info) Small application that returns relevant information for the video Game League of legends to notify pinging ( game communications) in the last match. Its more of a niche project to notify when ur friends are trying to climb but refuse to communicate
    -   [Python Redis App](https://github.com/chrisabedi/game_analytics) This is another small crud Django application to keep track of ur friends league of legends rank and games win/lose streak, its a WIP and would need a front end interface (like a discord bot) to hit this API and take commands easily
