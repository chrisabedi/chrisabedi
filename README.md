## Hi I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Backend engineer working on sharpening up on Go and Python and TypeScript have 6+ years of professional experience in mostly in TypeScript and Node.js
but like to get exposure to other tech stacks when I can

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
    - Go, Python, and related API Frameworks like Gin, flask, django

- ðŸ”­ Some random portfolio URLS
    -   [R3BasicAnimations](https://chrisabedi.github.io/r3basicanimation/) Showcase of using animations in React.js and THREE.js -a popular 3D rendering engine
    -   [LP Discord Bot](https://github.com/chrisabedi/league-info) Discord bot that returns relevant information to you and your discord server whom are grinding League of legends. Pretty much gives you a status update for any gameName#tagline in NA with wins/losses rank/ tier.
    -   [Python Redis App](https://github.com/chrisabedi/game_analytics) This is another crud Django api app with a small redis noSQL db to keep track of ur friends league of legends rank and games win/lose streak, its a WIP and would need a front end interface (like a discord bot) to hit this API and take commands easily (functionally similar as the previous but persistent data and not connected to discord)
