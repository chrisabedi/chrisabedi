## Hi I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹


I'm a Backend engineer working on sharpening up on Go, Python, and TypeScript. I have 6+ years of professional experience in mostly in TypeScript and Node.js but like to get exposure to other tech stacks :)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
    - Go, Python, and related API Frameworks like Gin, flask, django
    - Using LLM self hosted code tools like ollama, codellama, and webui as well as vscode extensions like continue

- ðŸ”­ Some random portfolio URLS
    -   [Surveil](https://surveil.onrender.com/) is a fullstack TypeScript App that takes an import of moxfield.com's deck list exporter and passes information about the particular deck, such as to which game changers are present, the average mana cost for spells, and other relevant information for Magic the Gathering Enthusiasts. It uses ConnectionPooling on the backend in order to make roughly 100 api calls and display the react front end with minimum (free tier) hosting on render :)
    -   [R3BasicAnimations](https://chrisabedi.github.io/r3basicanimation/) Showcase of using animations in React.js and THREE.js -a popular 3D rendering engine
    -   [LP Discord Bot](https://github.com/chrisabedi/league-info) Discord bot that returns relevant information to you and your discord server whom are grinding League of legends. Pretty much gives you a status update for any gameName#tagline in NA with wins/losses rank/ tier.
    -   [Python Redis App](https://github.com/chrisabedi/game_analytics) This is another crud Django api app with a small redis noSQL db to keep track of ur friends league of legends rank and games win/lose streak, its a WIP and would need a front end interface (like a discord bot) to hit this API and take commands easily (functionally similar as the previous but persistent data and not connected to discord)
